Compiling to wasm by using <code>embind</code> can also make your code running on both browser and Node.js, but when targeting Node.js, we prefer compiling to Node.js native addon instead of wasm for native performance. So in this case you probably need to write Node-API binding for Node.js and <code>embind</code> binding for Emscripten WebAssembly. Look, you just want to make your native dependencies could be used in JavaScript world but you are doing duplicated things.</p><p>Another use case of emnapi is that you want to make your addon run on <a href="https://stackblitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">StackBlitz</a>&#39;s WebContainer.</p><h2 id="browser-compatibility" tabindex="-1">Browser Compatibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#browser-compatibility" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s forget IE.</p><p><code>emnapi</code> JavaScript code is all ES5, but requires ES6 globals like <code>WeakMap</code>, and <a href="/emnapi-docs/reference/list.html">some of APIs</a> requires <code>BigInt</code>, <code>WeakRef</code> and <code>FinalizationRegistry</code> which is very new in ECMA Standard, so if you are using those APIs, your code will not work on old browsers or old version Node.js.
